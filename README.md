### mkydebug

My attempt to make the best "printf" debugging I can; tho its taken to long already.

For opend and Im still a little fuzzy on what shipping a lib looks like for that.

I will need a windows dev as I always do to give a shit about windows, I know where windows will just be broken, fixing it means testing on a windows machine tho.

Several of the sub-libs belong in an std, but will be in a "good enough for me" state. These could use genertification and completion then intergation into a larger project.

Testing on real projects by poeple who airnt me.
